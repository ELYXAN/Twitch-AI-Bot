ü§ñ Twitch AI Chatbot via Channel Points
A Python bot that connects to your Twitch chat, listens for a specific channel point reward, and uses the OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-4o) to answer user prompts directly in chat.

‚ú® Features
Channel Point Integration: Triggers only on a custom channel point reward that you specify.

OpenAI API Integration: Leverages modern language models like gpt-4o or gpt-3.5-turbo to generate intelligent responses.

Automatic Token Refresh: Uses a secure refresh token mechanism to automatically and safely authenticate with Twitch on every startup. No more manual password updates.

Customizable Personality: The system prompt can be easily modified to give the bot a unique personality.

Simple Configuration: All important settings are collected at the top of the script for easy access.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to get the bot running for your channel.

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
2. Create a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies clean.

Bash

# Create the environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:

Bash

pip install twitchio openai requests
‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Open the main.py file and fill in the following configuration variables with your own data.

Twitch Configuration
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID & TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET:

Go to the Twitch Developer Console.

Register a new application (Category: "Chat Bot").

Set the "OAuth Redirect URL" to http://localhost:3000.

Copy the Client ID and generate/copy the Client Secret.

TWITCH_REFRESH_TOKEN:

You must generate this token one time. Follow the instructions in the official Twitch guide, specifically the "Authorization Code Grant Flow". This process will give you the long-lived refresh token required for the script. Important: Generate this token for the bot account.

TWITCH_BOT_NICK: The username of your bot account (all lowercase). Creating a separate Twitch account for your bot is highly recommended.

TWITCH_CHANNEL: The name of your main streaming channel where the bot will operate (all lowercase).

OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY: You can find your API key in your OpenAI Dashboard.

Channel Reward Configuration
CUSTOM_REWARD_ID:

In your Twitch Creator Dashboard, create a new Channel Point Reward. Important: Enable the option "Requires Viewer to Enter Text".

Run the included get_rewards.py script to list the IDs of all your rewards.

Copy the correct ID and paste it here.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Bot
Make sure your virtual environment (venv) is activated and all configuration variables are set. Then, start the script:

Bash

python main.py
If everything is correct, you will see a success message in your terminal, and the bot will post an "online" message in your Twitch chat.

üé® Customization
You can easily customize the bot's behavior.

Changing the AI's Personality
Modify the system prompt in the event_message function to control the AI's personality and behavior.

Python

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        # CHANGE THIS LINE:
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a grumpy robot who answers questions reluctantly."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ],
    # ...
)
Changing the AI Model
Change the model argument to use a different OpenAI model (e.g., for better performance or lower cost). gpt-4o is an excellent modern choice.

Python

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",  # <-- CHANGE HERE
    # ...
)
